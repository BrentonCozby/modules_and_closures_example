##Instructions
Run the index.js file in node.

To do this, open up your favorite terminal and change directories so that you're inside of the directory with these files. Then type `node index.js`.

I encourage you to play with the code to learn how it works. Start by changing the values of the variables.

To learn more about how and why this code works, I highly encourage you to read [You Don't Know JavaScript: Scopes & Closures](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/README.md "You Don't Know JavaScript: Scopes & Closures") by Kyle Simpson, especially [Chapter 3: Function vs. Block Scope](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md "Chapter 3: Function vs. Block Scope") and [Chapter 5: Scope Closure](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch5.md "Chapter 5: Scope Closure").
